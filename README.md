Welcome to my second Git Repository # Project.
This Repository was made to keep track of my progress as I emback on a journey to learn Vue.
If you joined when I just started ensure your sitbelt is buckled and enjoy the ride.
If you joined during the journey welcome on board.
If you joined at the end it is not to late comment where you think changes can be made.

Everyone's input is appreciated.
